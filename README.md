For this task, I will be creating a Python script that scrapes course info from coursera.org
        
        To run this project, you should follow these steps;
                1- Download or pull this repo and open with VSCode
                2- Create environment with => python -m venv env
                3- Activate your environment with => env/Scripts/activate (for Windows)
                4- Install requirements for packages => pip install -r requirements.txt
                5- To run this project => python manage.py runserver
                6- To see working page, open your web browser and paste => http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
                or  left click to url "Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/"


        In this project, I followed these steps;
                1- Creating environment with => python -m venv env
                2- Activating env with => env/Scripts/activate (for Windows)
                3- Installing Django with => pip install django
                4- Crating project with => django-admin startproject main .
                5- Creating .env file for SECRET_KEY
                6- Installing requirements with => pip install -r requirements.txt
                7- Creating courseraScrap.py file to write our Scraping Codes
                8- Static file is for CSV files which we will download.
        
        P.S: Comments added to courseraScrap.py file for better understanding

Kind Regards,
